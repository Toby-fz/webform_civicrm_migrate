# webform_civicrm_migrate

Adapted from https://gist.github.com/jitendrapurohit/0c8f714934cd1530c7b4f4f8cf21b6f1

WIP attempt at a module that works alongside Webform Migrate to migrate Webform CiviCRM forms. 

Note we are not looking at migrating CiviCRM webform submission data (beyond what comes through from webform_migrate) as we assume this has all made it into CiviCRM anyway.

Requires webform_civicrm (obviously!) as well as webform_migrate and migrate_plus.
